 Question: What does this chart summarize?
Answer: The relationships between the various functions of a continuous random variable.

Question: What is the percentile of a random variable?
Answer: The 100th percentile is any value that satisfies the condition.

Question: What is the mode of a random variable?
Answer: The value that produces the largest PMF or PDF.

Question: What is the raw moment of a random variable?
Answer: It is defined as the mean, usually denoted by E(X).

Question: What is the central moment of a random variable?
Answer: It is defined as the variance, usually denoted by Var(X) or Ïƒ^2.Question: What is the standard deviation?
Answer: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

Question: What is the coefficient of variation?
Answer: The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.

Question: What is skewness?
Answer: Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution.

Question: What is kurtosis?
Answer: Kurtosis is a measure of the tailedness of a distribution.

Question: What is Bayes' Theorem?
Answer: Bayes' Theorem is a formula that calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge.

Question: What is the Law of Total Probability?
Answer: The Law of Total Probability states that the probability of an event can be calculated by considering all possible outcomes.

Question: What is the Law of Total Expectation?
Answer: The Law of Total Expectation states that the expected value of a random variable can be calculated by considering all possible outcomes.

Question: What is the Law of Total Variance?
Answer: The Law of Total Variance states that the variance of a random variable can be calculated by considering all possible outcomes.

Question: When are events A and B independent?
Answer: Events A and B are independent if and only if the probability of their intersection is equal to the product of their individual probabilities.

Question: What happens if random variables X and Y are independent?
Answer: If random variables X and Y are independent, then the joint probability distribution of X and Y is equal to the product of their individual probability distributions.

Question: What is an empirical distribution?
Answer: An empirical distribution is a discrete distribution based on a sample of data that assigns probabilities to each data point.

Question: What is an empirical distribution function?
Answer: An empirical distribution function is a step function that assigns a probability to each data point based on the empirical distribution.1. What does the term "percentile" refer to? 
100

2. Define the concept of sample mean.
Sample mean is the average value calculated from a set of measurements or observations.

3. What is meant by "biased sample variance"?
Biased sample variance refers to the measure of variability in a sample that is affected by systematic errors or biases.

4. Explain the concept of "unbiased sample variance".
Unbiased sample variance is a measure of variability in a sample that corrects for any systematic errors or biases, providing a more accurate estimate of the population variance.
