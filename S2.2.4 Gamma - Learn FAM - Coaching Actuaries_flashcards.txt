 question: What is the PDF of a gamma distribution with parameters α and β?

answer: The PDF of a gamma distribution with parameters α and β is f(x) = (1/β^α * Γ(α)) * x^(α-1) * e^(-x/β)

answer: The sum of independent gamma random variables, given that they have the same value of λ, is also a new gamma random variable.

question: How can we represent the sum of gamma random variables?

question: What is the relationship between exponential distribution and gamma distribution?
answer: The exponential distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution, i.e. it is a gamma distribution with α=1. 

question: What is the PDF, mean, and variance of the exponential distribution?
answer: The PDF, mean, and variance of the exponential distribution simplify to:

PDF(x) = λ * e^(-λx)
Mean = 1/λ
Variance = 1/λ^2

question: What is the memoryless property of the exponential distribution?
answer: The exponential distribution has the memoryless property, which loosely implies that what happened in the past does not affect what will happen in the future.question;answer
