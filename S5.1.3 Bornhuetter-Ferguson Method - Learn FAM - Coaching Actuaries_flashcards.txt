 question: What is the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?
answer: The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is a reserving technique that finds a balance between the chain-ladder method and the expected loss ratio method to estimate ultimate losses.

question: How does the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method find a balance between the chain-ladder method and the expected loss ratio method?
answer: The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method rationalizes the differences between the chain-ladder method, which relies on the loss triangle, and the expected loss ratio method, which only considers fully developed losses.

question: What is the formula for estimating the proportion of paid claims under the chain-ladder method?
answer: The formula for estimating the proportion of paid claims under the chain-ladder method is (paid claims)/(ultimate losses).

question: What is the formula for estimating the proportion of unpaid claims under the chain-ladder method?
answer: The formula for estimating the proportion of unpaid claims under the chain-ladder method is (unpaid claims)/(ultimate losses).

question: How can the unpaid claims estimate or reserve be calculated using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?
answer: The unpaid claims estimate or reserve can be calculated by multiplying the ultimate losses by the estimated proportion of unpaid claims.Question: What is the IBNR reserve if the age-to-ultimate factor is calculated using the incurred losses?
Answer: The IBNR reserve will be the incurred losses.

Question: How does the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method combine the expected loss ratio method and the reserve calculation?
Answer: It multiplies the expected loss ratio estimate of the ultimate losses by the chain-ladder estimate of the proportion of unpaid claims.

Question: What is the paid loss age-to-ultimate factor based on in the chain-ladder method?
Answer: It is based on the age of claims at valuation.

Question: Are the ultimate losses in the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method the same as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson estimate of the ultimate losses?
Answer: No, they are not the same.

Question: How does the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method estimate the ultimate losses?
Answer: It estimates the ultimate losses using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.Step 1: Estimate the ultimate losses using the expected loss ratio method.
Accident Year Estimated Ultimate Losses
AY4 3,840
AY5 3,510
AY6 4,015
AY7 4,543

Step 2: Calculate the volume-weighted average factor (VWAF).
VWAF = (Total Earned Premium / Total Expected Ultimate Losses)

Step 2: Calculate the volume-weighted average factor (VWAF).
VWAF = (Total Earned Premium / Total Expected Ultimate Losses)
VWAF = (6,000 + 5,400 + 7,300 + 7,700) / (3,840 + 3,510 + 4,015 + 4,543)

Step 3: Calculate the reserve as of 12/31/AY7 using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.
Reserve = (Total Loss Payments + (VWAF * Total Expected Ultimate Losses)) * (1 - Development Factor)

Step 3: Calculate the reserve as of 12/31/AY7 using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.
Reserve = (Total Loss Payments + (VWAF * Total Expected Ultimate Losses)) * (1 - Development Factor)
Reserve = (1,400 + 2,550 + 3,650 + 3,800 + (VWAF * (3,840 + 3,510 + 4,015 + 4,543))) * (1 - Development Factor)

The flashcards would be as follows:

Question: What is Step 1 in the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?
Answer: Estimate the ultimate losses using the expected loss ratio method.

Question: What are the estimated ultimate losses for each accident year?
Answer: AY4: 3,840; AY5: 3,510; AY6: 4,015; AY7: 4,543.

Question: What is Step 2 in the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?
Answer: Calculate the volume-weighted average factor (VWAF).

Question: How do you calculate the VWAF?
Answer: VWAF = (Total Earned Premium / Total Expected Ultimate Losses).

Question: What is Step 3 in the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?
Answer: Calculate the reserve as of 12/31/AY7 using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.

Question: How do you calculate the reserve?
Answer: Reserve = (Total Loss Payments + (VWAF * Total Expected Ultimate Losses)) * (1 - Development Factor).

Question: What is the formula for the reserve calculation?
Answer: Reserve = (1,400 + 2,550 + 3,650 + 3,800 + (VWAF * (3,840 + 3,510 + 4,015 + 4,543))) * (1 - Development Factor).Step 2: Estimate the age-to-ultimate loss development factors using the chain-ladder method.
AY4 3;1.000
AY5 2;1.041
AY6 1;1.375
AY7 0;2.451

Step 3: Estimate the reserves using .
AY5;139
AY6;1,095
AY7;2,690

The total reserve is the sum of the Reserve column.

The Bornhuetter-Ferguson reserve can also be calculated as the weighted average of the chain-ladder and expected loss ratio reserves.Question: What are the expected loss ratio reserves?
