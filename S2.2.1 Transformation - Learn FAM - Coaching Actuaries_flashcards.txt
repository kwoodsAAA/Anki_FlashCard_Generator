 question: What is the purpose of transforming random variables?
answer: To determine the distribution of a random variable that is a function of another random variable.

question: What are the steps to determine the PDF of a transformed random variable?
answer: 1. Determine the CDF of the original random variable.
        2. Restate the CDF of the transformed random variable using the CDF of the original random variable.
        3. Determine the PDF of the transformed random variable.Question: What is the CDF of the random variable X?
Answer: A random variable X follows a distribution with the given CDF.

Question: What is the random variable Y?
Answer: Y is another random variable.

Question: What is the PDF of Y?
Answer: To find the PDF of Y, we need to follow the steps mentioned in the solution.

Question: What is Step 1?
Answer: Skip Step 1 because we already have the CDF of Y.

Question: What is Step 2?
Answer: Restate the CDF of Y using the CDF of X.

Question: What is Step 3?
Answer: Determine the PDF of Y.
