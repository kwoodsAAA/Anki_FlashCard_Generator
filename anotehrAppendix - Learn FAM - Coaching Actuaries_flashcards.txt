What is the special property of Pareto distributions?;Pareto distributions have a CDF that resembles the CDF of another Pareto distribution with different parameters.
What is the CDF transformation method used for?;The CDF transformation method is used to transform a distribution into another distribution with a similar CDF.
What is the relationship between a Pareto distribution and an inverse Pareto distribution?;A Pareto distribution with parameters (α, β) resembles the CDF of an inverse Pareto distribution with parameters (β, α).
What is the CDF transformation method used for in the context of Pareto and Single-Parameter Pareto distributions?;The CDF transformation method is used to transform a distribution into another distribution with a similar CDF, specifically in the context of Pareto and Single-Parameter Pareto distributions.question;answer
What is a single-parameter Pareto distribution with parameters?;The single-parameter Pareto distribution has a domain that shifts from 0 to infinity, and is defined by the inequality x > x0, where x0 is a positive constant.
What is the Poisson Shortcut for Incomplete Gamma Function?;For k is a positive integer, the Poisson Shortcut for Incomplete Gamma Function is given by the formula P(X ≤ k) = 1 - e^(-λ) * ∑(i=0 to k) (λ^i / i!)
What is the relationship between a gamma distribution and an inverse gamma distribution?;For X following a gamma distribution with parameters α and β, the CDF of X resembles the CDF of an inverse gamma distribution with parameters β and α.
What is the Exponential and Inverse Exponential?;For X following an exponential distribution with mean μ, the PDF of X is given by f(x) = (1/μ) * e^(-x/μ). The inverse exponential distribution is the reciprocal of the exponential distribution.
