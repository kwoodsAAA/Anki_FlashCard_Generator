 Q: What is partial credibility?
A: Partial credibility is assigned when the experience is inadequate for full credibility.

Q: What is the purpose of credibility in insurance?
A: The purpose of credibility is to assign weights to different sources in order to produce the best estimate of the future outcome.

Q: What is the credibility premium?
A: The credibility premium is the estimate of the future outcome and is denoted as .

Q: How is the credibility premium calculated in the case of partial credibility?
A: The credibility premium in the case of partial credibility is calculated by assigning a weight of  to the sample mean and a weight of  to the value from a more general source, commonly known as the manual premium.

Q: What does represent in the calculation of the credibility premium?
A: represents the sample mean.

Q: What does represent in the calculation of the credibility premium?
A: represents the manual premium.

Q: How is determined in a classical credibility problem?
A: is determined by taking the average of the observations provided.question: Under classical credibility theory, how can  be calculated?
answer:  can be calculated using the square root rule.

question: What does the square root rule state?
answer: The square root rule states that if there is not full credibility, then 

question: What does  represent in the square root rule?
answer:  represents the number of exposures needed for full credibility.

question: What does  represent in the square root rule?
answer:  represents the actual number of exposures.

question: What does  represent in the square root rule?
answer:  represents the expected number of claims needed for full credibility.

question: What does  represent in the square root rule?
answer:  represents the actual number of claims.question: What is the formula for calculating credibility?
answer: credibility = number of claims / number of exposures

question: When does the formula for credibility have two forms?
answer: The formula has two forms when the numerator and denominator are consistent in units.

question: What is the purpose of using an approximation for the number of claims?
answer: The approximation is used when the actual number of claims is unknown or assumed to be unknown.

question: How can you calculate the credibility if 60,000 exposures are observed?
answer: Using the square root rule, the credibility would be less than 1 because less than 80,000 exposures have been observed.

question: How can you calculate the credibility if 120,000 exposures are observed?
answer: If 120,000 exposures are observed, the credibility would be 1 because the full number of exposures needed for credibility has been observed.Question: What is the standard for full credibility for a specific type of policy?
Answer: The standard for full credibility is set so that the claim frequency is within 3% of the true value 90% of the time.

Question: What is the credibility factor for a group with 800 insureds?
Answer: The credibility factor is 80%.

Question: What is the new standard for full credibility for the same group of insureds?
Answer: The new standard for full credibility is set so that the claim frequency is within 3% of the true value 99% of the time.

Question: How do we calculate the revised credibility factor?
Answer: We need to revise the number of exposures/claims needed for full credibility based on the new standard, and then use that number to calculate the revised credibility factor.question;What is the claim frequency?
answer;The claim frequency is denoted as .
question;What is the formula for calculating the number of exposures needed for full credibility using the square root rule?
answer;The formula is .
question;What is the formula for calculating the number of claims needed to meet the revised standard for full credibility?
answer;The formula is .
question;What is the formula for calculating the revised credibility factor?
answer;The formula is .
question;What is an alternative method for calculating the revised credibility factor without solving for  and its revised version?
answer;The alternative method is to use the formula .Question: What is the formula for the full credibility for claim frequency?
Answer: The formula can be easily derived from the given information.

Question: What distribution does the annual claim frequency follow?
Answer: The annual claim frequency follows a Poisson distribution.

Question: What distribution do the individual claim sizes follow?
Answer: The individual claim sizes follow an inverse Gaussian distribution with parameters  and .

Question: Are the claim frequency and severity independent?
Answer: Yes, the claim frequency and severity are independent.

Question: What is the full credibility standard established in this example?
Answer: The full credibility standard is that the aggregate claim is within 10% of its mean 90% of the time.

Question: What is the manual premium for the annual aggregate claim?
Answer: The manual premium is 10,000.

Question: How many claims were observed in the previous year?
Answer: 200 claims were observed in the previous year.

Question: What was the total claim size in the previous year?
Answer: The total claim size in the previous year was 12,000.

Question: What method is used to calculate the credibility premium for the current year?
Answer: Limited fluctuation credibility is used to calculate the credibility premium for the current year.1. What are the variables used in partial credibility calculations?

- Apply [formula] to calculate

6. What should be comparable in terms of quantity in partial credibility calculations?
- The sample mean and the manual premium

7. What is the manual premium used for in partial credibility calculations?
- To calculate the credibility premiumQuestion: What is the formula for calculating the annual aggregate claim?
Answer: The annual aggregate claim is the average of the observed annual aggregate claims.

Question: What is the observed number of exposures?
Answer: The observed number of exposures is 1.

Question: What is the formula for calculating the sample mean?
Answer: The sample mean is the observed total amount across all exposures divided by the observed number of exposures.
