 1. What is the PDF of a beta distribution?
Answer: A beta distribution's PDF is recognizable from its finite support and its purely polynomial terms, i.e. no negative powers of x, and no exponential or logarithmic terms.

2. What do many students forget about the PDF of a beta distribution?
Answer: Many students forget the term at the end even though the PDF is available on the exam table.

3. What are the mean and variance of a beta distribution?
Answer: The mean and variance of a beta distribution depend on the parameters α and β.

4. What simplification can be made to the PDF of a beta distribution when α = β?
Answer: When α = β, the PDF simplifies to which makes it easier to integrate and recognize as beta.

5. What is the second moment of a random variable with a given PDF?
Answer: The second moment of a random variable can be determined by integrating x^2 times the PDF over its support.Question: What is the support of a beta distribution?
Answer: The support is from 0 to 1.

Question: What is the PDF of a beta distribution?
Answer: The PDF of a beta distribution with [parameter] is in the form of [PDF formula].

Question: How can we deduce the parameters of a beta distribution?
Answer: Compare the given PDF to the PDF formula to deduce the parameters.

Question: What is the moment formula for a beta distribution?
Answer: Look up beta's moment formula in the exam table.

Question: What is the second moment of a beta distribution?
Answer: The second moment of a beta distribution can be calculated using the moment formula.

Question: What is a uniform distribution?
Answer: A uniform distribution has a constant density.

Question: What is the PDF of a uniform distribution?
Answer: The PDF of a uniform distribution on the interval [a, b] is [PDF formula].

Question: What is the mean of a uniform distribution?
Answer: The mean is the midpoint of the interval.

Question: What is the variance of a uniform distribution?
Answer: The variance of a uniform distribution is [(b-a)^2]/12.

Question: How can the second raw moment of a uniform distribution be calculated?
Answer: The second raw moment can be calculated by adding the variance to the square of the mean.question;A uniform distribution on the interval [a, b] is equivalent to a beta distribution with parameters α=1 and β=1.
question;Assume X is uniformly distributed on the interval [a, b]. Then, given it is greater than c, where c is a value between a and b, X will be uniformly distributed on the interval [c, b].
question;Shifting X leftwards by k will shift the endpoints of the interval [a, b] by the same amount k.
