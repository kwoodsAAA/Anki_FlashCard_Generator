 Question: What is the Tail-Value-at-Risk (TVaR) or the conditional tail expectation (CTE) of a continuous random variable at the 100 % security level?
Answer: The TVaR or CTE is the conditional expected value given that the random variable exceeds its VaR at the 100 % level.

Question: How can we express the TVaR in terms of the mean excess loss?
Answer: To avoid integration, we can express the TVaR in terms of the mean excess loss introduced in Section S2.3.

Question: Why is the mean excess loss useful?
Answer: It is useful because the VaR formula for most distributions is already included in the exam table.

Question: How does the TVaR help actuaries study extreme losses?
Answer: Similar to VaR, the TVaR helps actuaries study extreme losses by providing information about the average loss amount for losses greater than a certain VaR.

Question: Can you provide an example of TVaR?
Answer: Sure! For example, if the TVaR at the 95% security level is 5,000, it means that for losses greater than its 95% VaR, the average loss amount is 5,000.

Question: What is the purpose of working on examples?
Answer: Working on examples helps to better understand and apply the concepts discussed.

Question: Can you provide an example for further practice?
Answer: Certainly! Let's consider an example of a random variable with a given density function.Loss amount;Solution to (2)
VaR of x at the 75% level;Solution to (1)
To determine x, use:
- the Value-at-Risk of x at the 75% security level.
- the Tail-Value-at-Risk of x at the 75% security level.
75 percentile of x;1.8028
Complement of 1.8028;0.25
Upper bound of x;2
TVaR of x at the 75% level;A value between 1.8028 and 2question: What is the problem asking to calculate?
answer: Calculate the TVaR of at the 85% level.

question: Why can't we use the CDF to calculate the TVaR?
answer: The question does not provide the full distribution function, so the CDF cannot be used because it requires the PDF.

question: What should we use instead of the CDF?
answer: Apply the concept of limited expected values.

question: What is the definition of TVaR?
answer: TVaR is the value of a random variable that produces a specific probability level.

question: How can we compute the TVaR using limited expected values?
answer: Compute the expected value of the random variable beyond the desired probability level.

question: What is the shortcut for calculating TVaR for a lognormal distribution?
answer: The exam tables do not provide the formula for TVaR of a lognormal distribution, but we can derive a shortcut using limited expected values.question: If is lognormal with parameters  and , then
answer: The derivation is provided in the appendix at the end of this section.
question: The advantage of using  is that this formula does not require the calculation of . Therefore, while  can still be used, we recommend memorizing  to speed up calculations.

The formula below should be memorized because it is impractical to use  or  for the normal distribution under exam conditions.
question: If  is normal with parameters  and , then
answer: where  is the PDF of a standard normal distribution. Do not confuse  with , which is the CDF of a standard normal. The derivation is provided in the appendix at the end of this section.
