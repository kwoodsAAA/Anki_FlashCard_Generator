 1. What are the special properties included in the summary for continuous distributions?
Answer: PDF, CDF, mean, and variance formulas

2. Why are the PDF, CDF, mean, and variance formulas not listed in the summary?
Answer: They are either provided on the exam table or can be derived from other quantities.

3. What is the S-P Pareto distribution?
Answer: It is a Pareto distribution shifted rightwards by a constant.

4. How does the mean of the S-P Pareto distribution compare to the mean of the Pareto distribution?
Answer: The mean of the S-P Pareto distribution is greater than the mean of the Pareto distribution.

5. Do the S-P Pareto distribution and the Pareto distribution have the same variance?
Answer: Yes, they have the same variance.

6. What is the exponential distribution?
Answer: It is a special case of the gamma distribution.

7. What is the relationship between the exponential distribution and the gamma distribution?
Answer: The exponential distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 1.

8. What is the distribution of the sum of i.i.d. exponential random variables?
Answer: It follows a gamma distribution with parameters α and β.

9. What is the memoryless property of the exponential distribution?
Answer: The memoryless property states that the probability of an event occurring in the future does not depend on how long the event has already been occurring.

10. How to determine the CDF of a beta distribution?
Answer: Use the CDF of a beta distribution.

11. How to restate the CDF of a beta distribution using the CDF of another distribution?
Answer: Restate the CDF of the beta distribution using the CDF of another distribution.

Answer: Use the PDF of a beta distribution.question;answer
Distribution CDF Mean Variance Percentile
Standar d normal;The standard normal distribution is a special case of the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Normal;The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution characterized by its mean and standard deviation.
Lognormal;The lognormal distribution is a distribution that is obtained by taking the exponential of a normal distribution.
Inverse Distributions;If a random variable X follows a certain distribution that has a parameter θ and an inverse counterpart, then 1/X follows the inverse counterpart with the same parameters, except θ is inverted.
Pareto;The Pareto distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is commonly used to model extreme events.
Exponential;The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that models the time between events in a Poisson process.
Uniform;The uniform distribution is a continuous probability distribution that has a constant probability density function over a specified interval.
Linear Exponential Family;Any distribution with a probability function that can be expressed in the form f(x|θ) = exp(η(θ)T(x) - A(θ) + B(x)) belongs to the linear exponential family.
Roles of parameters;All distributions listed in the exam tables that have a θ parameter (except inverse Gaussian) are parameterized by that parameter.Q: How do you scale a continuous distribution listed on the exam tables except lognormal, inverse Gaussian, and log-? 
A: Multiply the parameter  by the scaling factor.

Q: How do you scale a normal distribution? 
A: Multiply the mean and the standard deviation by the scaling factor.

Q: How do you scale a lognormal distribution? 
A: Add the natural log of the scaling factor to the parameter .

Q: How do you scale all other distributions? 
A: Use the transformation technique discussed at the beginning of this section.

Q: What is a discrete mixture? 
A: A random variable  is a discrete mixture of the random variables , , ...,  if its PDF is given by.

Q: Is a mixture the same as a linear combination of random variables? 
A: No, a mixture is different from a linear combination of random variables.

Q: What is the abbreviation for Bernoulli distribution? 
A: The abbreviation is "BERNOULLI".Question: What is a random variable?
Answer: A random variable is a variable that can take on different values with certain probabilities.

Question: How many values can a random variable take on in this case?
Answer: In this case, the random variable can only take on two values.

Question: What are the two values that the random variable can take on?
Answer: The two values that the random variable can take on are [value 1] and [value 2].

Question: What is the probability of the random variable taking on the first value?
Answer: The probability of the random variable taking on the first value is [probability 1].

Question: What is the probability of the random variable taking on the second value?
Answer: The probability of the random variable taking on the second value is [probability 2].
