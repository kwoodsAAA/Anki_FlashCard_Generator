answer: The Law of Total Expectation states that E(X) = E(E(X|Y))Question: What does the Law of Total Variance state?
Answer: The Law of Total Variance states that the variance of a random variable can be decomposed into the sum of the conditional variance and the variance of the conditional mean.

Question: Why is it incorrect to assume that the unconditional variance equals the average of the conditional variances?
Answer: It is incorrect because the variance of the conditional mean also needs to be included in the calculation.
