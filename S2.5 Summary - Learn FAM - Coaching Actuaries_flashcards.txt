 1. What is the definition of Aggregate Loss Models? Sum of all individual losses.
2. What is the definition of Collective Risk Model? All existing severities are i.i.d. and frequency and severity are independent.
3. What is the definition of Individual Risk Model? Severities are independent but may not be identical, and frequency is a constant.
4. How do you approximate with a normal distribution? Use the Normal Approximation.
5. How do you approximate with a lognormal distribution? Use the Lognormal Approximation.
6. When is Continuity Correction needed? Continuity Correction is needed when both frequency and severity are discrete.
7. How do you calculate the aggregate mean and variance for Stop-Loss Insurance? Calculate the aggregate mean and variance.
8. How do you solve for the parameters  and  in Stop-Loss Insurance? Equate lognormal mean and variance to aggregate mean and variance.
9. What is the final step in calculating the desired quantity in Stop-Loss Insurance? Calculate the desired quantity based on the approximating distribution.Question: What does a stop-loss insurance refer to?
Answer: An insurance that imposes an aggregate deductible.

Question: How is an aggregate deductible applied?
Answer: It is applied to the aggregate loss.

Question: How is an ordinary deductible applied?
Answer: It is applied to individual claims.

Question: What is the net stop-loss premium?
Answer: The net stop-loss premium is the number of losses (N) multiplied by the payment per loss (P).

Question: What does aggregate payments refer to?
Answer: Aggregate payments are the sum of all individual payments.

Question: What is important to ensure when considering the frequency and severity of losses or payments?
Answer: It is important to ensure that both frequency and severity are in terms of either losses or payments.
