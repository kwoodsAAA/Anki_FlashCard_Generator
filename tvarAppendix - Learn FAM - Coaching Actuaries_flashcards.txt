 1. What is the general form of the lognormal VaR? The general form of the lognormal VaR is derived from the solution to (2) in Example S2.6.1.1.
2. What is the TVaR for a lognormal random variable? The TVaR for a lognormal random variable is calculated using the derived general form.
3. What is the standard normal random variable denoted as? The standard normal random variable is denoted as Z.
4. What are the 100 percentile values of Z and X? The 100 percentile values of Z and X are denoted as Zp and Xp, respectively.
5. What method was used to evaluate the integral? The substitution method was used to evaluate the integral.
6. What is the value of the integral after substitution? The value of the integral after substitution is denoted as T.
7. What method was used to disprove substitution? The substitution method was used to disprove substitution.question: What is the subadditivity property for VaR?
answer: The subadditivity property states that the VaR of the sum of two random variables is less than or equal to the sum of their individual VaR values.

question: Define two i.i.d. random variables X and Y.
answer: X and Y are independent and identically distributed random variables.

question: Evaluate the probability function of X + Y.
answer: The probability function of X + Y is the sum of the probability functions of X and Y.

question: Does subadditivity hold for all conditions?
answer: No, subadditivity does not hold under all conditions.

question: What property does VaR fail to satisfy?
answer: VaR fails to satisfy the subadditivity property.

question: What is the key to the first two tests?
answer: The key is to realize that shifting or scaling a random variable will also shift or scale its percentiles.

question: What is translation invariance?
answer: Translation invariance is the property that shifting a random variable by a constant does not change its VaR.

question: What is positive homogeneity?
answer: Positive homogeneity is the property that scaling a random variable by a positive constant multiplies its VaR by the same constant.If \(x > t\), then \(TVaR_t(x) \geq TVaR_t(x + c)\) for any positive constant \(c\).
