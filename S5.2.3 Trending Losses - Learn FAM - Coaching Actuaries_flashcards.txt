The experience period is the period in which losses from historical claims could occur.

What are the two types of data that can be used for the experience period?

The two types of data that can be used for the experience period are accident year data and policy year data.

What is accident year data?

Accident year data contain loss data for all losses occurring in a specific one-year period.

answer: The expected effective period is the period in which losses can occur for policies written using the new rates.

question: How is the length of the expected effective period determined?
answer: The length of the expected effective period is determined as the sum of two quantities: the policy term and the length of time for which the new rates are in effect.

question: Why is the expected effective period longer than the policy term?
answer: The expected effective period is longer than the policy term because policies will be sold at the new rate for as long as the rates are in effect and because the last policy sold will be in effect for the length of the policy term.

What is the trended ultimate loss for AY2017?;3,844.66
What is the projected ultimate losses for the forecast period?;Weighted average of trended ultimate losses using assigned weights.forecast period has the same length as the policy term. Hence, the average loss occurrence date is the midpoint of a one-year period.;The average loss occurrence date is the midpoint of a one-year period.
Since policies are written only on June 1, 2018,  the average loss occurrence date of the forecast period is December 1, 2018,  which is the midpoint of the period from June 1, 2018 to June 1, 2019.;The average loss occurrence date of the forecast period is December 1, 2018.
