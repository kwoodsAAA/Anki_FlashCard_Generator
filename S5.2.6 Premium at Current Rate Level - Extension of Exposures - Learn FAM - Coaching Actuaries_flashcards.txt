 1. What is the purpose of bringing historical premiums to the current rate level in the ratemaking process?
- They must be brought to the current rate level for them to be useful in the ratemaking process.

2. What are the two approaches to adjust premiums to the current rate level?
- The extension of exposures method and the parallelogram method.

3. What is an exposure in the context of adjusting premiums?
- An exposure is the basic unit used to determine premium.

4. How does the unit of exposure vary depending on the product and line of business?

5. Can you give an example of how exposures are measured in the auto insurance industry?

Answer: In ratemaking, earned exposures are used to match premiums and loss experience.

Question: How does the extension of exposures method work in ratemaking?
Answer: The extension of exposures method involves recalculating the premiums of historical policies under the current rate level.

Question: What is the advantage of using the extension of exposures method?
Answer: The extension of exposures method is considered the most accurate current rate level method.

Question: Why do companies often not have all the necessary historical rating information for the extension of exposures method?
Answer: Companies often do not have all the necessary historical rating information to apply the extension of exposures method.

Question: What is the general process for pricing an insurance product?

The on-level premium for a specific policy is the value of the premium after it has been brought to the current rate level. 

How is the premium charged for a policy calculated?
The premium charged for a policy is calculated by multiplying the base rate by the relativities for the specific risk factors, and then summing them up.
