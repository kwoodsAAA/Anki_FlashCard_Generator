Q: What are the two cases where the ultimate formula is not commonly seen?
A: 1) Franchise deductible, where the maximum covered loss is less than it would be for an ordinary deductible.
2) Adding back the effect of the deductible for the portion of loss above the deductible.Question: What is the formula for calculating coinsurance?
Answer: coinsurance = deductible / coinsurance factor

Answer: The deductible is 600.

Question: How much higher are the losses assumed to be next year?
Answer: The losses are assumed to be 20% higher next year.

Question: What are the options the insurer is considering adding to the policy starting next year?
Answer: The options are a policy limit of 3,000 or a coinsurance.

Question: What is the formula for calculating expected payments under the policy limit option?
Answer: Expected payment = [CDF value at policy limit] * [policy limit]

Question: What is the formula for calculating expected payments under the coinsurance option?
Answer: Expected payment = [CDF value at deductible] * [deductible] / [coinsurance factor]

Question: What is the equation used to solve for the coinsurance factor?
Answer: Equate the two expected payments and solve for the coinsurance factor.Question: What is the usual involvement of a distribution that asks for the variance of the payment?
Answer: It usually involves a distribution that has a special property or a simple payment structure.

Question: What does Example S2.3.4.4 illustrate?
Answer: Example S2.3.4.4 illustrates a distribution with a special property.

Answer: The deductible is 20 and the maximum covered loss is 100.

Question: What type of distribution do the losses follow in the given insurance policy?
Answer: The losses follow a uniform distribution on the interval 0 to 200.

Question: What does a policy limit of 100 indicate?
Answer: A policy limit of 100 indicates a maximum covered loss of 80.Question: What is the formula for variance?
Answer: The variance is the second moment minus the first moment squared.

Question: How can you calculate the moments of a variable?
Answer: A simpler way to calculate 's moments is by calculating 's moments, and then converting them.

Question: What is the payment per loss variable?
Answer: The insurer pays nothing for losses below the deductible; the amount in excess of the deductible for losses between the deductible and the maximum covered loss; the policy limit for losses greater than the maximum covered loss. The payment per loss variable is .

Question: How can you calculate the first and second moments using first principles?
