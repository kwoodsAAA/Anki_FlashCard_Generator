 1. What do actuaries consider when studying adverse outcomes?
Answer: Actuaries consider the tail weight of loss distributions.

2. What does the tail weight of loss distributions describe?
Answer: The tail weight describes the likelihood of extreme losses occurring.

3. What does a heavier tail weight imply?
Answer: A heavier tail weight implies that large claims are more likely to occur.

4. What is the definition of "tail" in this lesson?
Answer: In this lesson, "tail" refers to the right tail of a distribution.

5. What is the purpose of modeling adverse outcomes?
Answer: The purpose is to study and understand the impact of extreme events on an insurance company's solvency.

What is the purpose of comparing the tails of distributions using the number of positive raw moments test?;To determine which distribution has a heavier tail.
What does it mean for a distribution to have a heavier tail?;It means that the distribution produces larger values than another distribution in its tail.
Why is constructing every PDF by hand during the exam impractical?;Because it is time-consuming and inefficient.
What is Model A in the given example?;Model A is a Pareto distribution with parameters alpha and xmin.
What is Model B in the given example?;Model B is an exponential distribution with parameter lambda.
How can we determine the model with the heavier tail using the number of positive raw moments?;By comparing the number of positive raw moments of each distribution.
What is the purpose of the number of positive raw moments test?;To measure the tail weight of a distribution.
Which distribution has a heavier tail in the given example?;The Pareto distribution (Model A) has a heavier tail than the exponential distribution (Model B).
