How do you calculate the indicated overall average rate or rate change?;Let's go back to the fundamental insurance equation and solve for the indicated premium.
What does the indicated premium include?;The indicated premium includes both losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE).
How do you solve the equation for the indicated premium?;You can solve the equation by dividing the indicated premium by the permissible loss ratio.
What are the two ways to proceed from this point depending on the available data?;The two ways to proceed are the loss ratio method 1 and the loss ratio method 2.Question
Why is it called the loss ratio method?;This formula uses , or the loss ratio, which is why this is called the loss ratio method.
What is the formula used for the pure premium method?;Let  be the number of exposures. If we divide  by , we will have
Why is it called the pure premium method?;This method is called the pure premium method because  is the pure premium, or loss per exposure.Question
Is the indicated average rate change associated with a specific rating variable?;No, it is the overall average rate change across all rating variables.
What are the given values for the calculation?;Premium at current rate level = 120,000; Projected loss and loss adjustment expenses = 74,000; Projected number of exposures = 1,000; Variable expense ratio = 20%; Fixed expenses per exposure unit = 25; Target profit and contingencies = 5%; Current average rate = 120.
What is the indicated average rate change under the loss ratio method?;9/30/23, 6
What is the indicated average rate under the pure premium method?;The indicated average rate is not provided in the given information.question;Apply under the pure premium method. The indicated average rate is
What are the on-level factors for each calendar year?;2015 - 1.0775; 2016 - 1.0538; 2017 - 1.0244
What are the earned premiums at the current rate level for each calendar year?;2015 - $1,209; 2016 - $1,217; 2017 - $1,312
What are the loss ratios for each calendar year?;2015 - 0.9098; 2016 - 0.8746; 2017 - 0.7786
What is the projected loss ratio for the forecast period?;Average of the loss ratios
What is the equation used to calculate the average rate using the pure premium method?;The equation used to calculate the average rate is given by
What is the first step in calculating the projected pure premium?;The first step is to calculate the average loss occurrence date for every experience period and the forecast period.
What is the average loss occurrence date for AY2016?;The average loss occurrence date for AY2016 is July 1, 2016.
What is the average loss occurrence date for AY2017?;The average loss occurrence date for AY2017 is July 1, 2017.
What is the average loss occurrence date for the forecast period?;The average loss occurrence date for the forecast period is April 1, 2020.
How do you calculate the trended ultimate losses?;The trended ultimate losses can be calculated by multiplying the ultimate losses by the trend factor.
What is the trend factor for AY2016?;The trend factor for AY2016 is
What is the trend factor for AY2017?;The trend factor for AY2017 is
What is the trended pure premium for AY2016?;For AY2016, the trended pure premium is 427.79.
What is the trended pure premium for AY2017?;For AY2017, the trended pure premium is [answer not provided].
What is Step 4 in the process?;Then, the projected pure premium is the weighted average of the trended pure premiums.
What is Step 5 in the process?;Finally, the indicated premium per exposure is [answer not provided].
How can we calculate the trended pure premiums?;Instead of trending the ultimate losses and then calculating the pure premiums, we can also calculate and then trend the pure premiums. Divide the ultimate losses by the earned exposures to calculate the pure premium. Then, calculate the trended pure premium by applying the trend factor. The results will be identical.
What is the pure premium for AY2016?;For AY2016, the pure premium is 404.39.
What is the expected value formula using the survival function method?;The expected value of a function can be rewritten as follows using integration by parts.
What are the requirements for simplifying the expected value formula?;The two requirements that need to be fulfilled are
What is the formula for the central moment?;The formula for the central moment is  .
What is the formula for the 4th central moment?;The formula for the 4th central moment is .Question
How do we apply the Law of Total Expectation?;We apply the Law of Total Expectation by taking the expectation of the conditional variance and adding it to the variance of the conditional mean.
What is the equation for the Law of Total Variance?;The equation for the Law of Total Variance is Var(X) = E[Var(X|Y)] + Var(E[X|Y]).
How can we translate the second half of the equation for the Law of Total Variance?;The second half of the equation for the Law of Total Variance can be translated to Var(E[X|Y]) = E[Var(X|Y)] + Var(E[X]).
What are the two forms of the Biased Sample Variance?;The two forms of the Biased Sample Variance are the sample variance formula using the sum of squared deviations and the sample variance formula using the sum of squared observations.
Define two i.i.d. random variables X and Y.;X and Y are independent and identically distributed random variables.
Evaluate the probability function of X + Y.;The probability function of X + Y is the sum of the probability functions of X and Y.
Does subadditivity hold for all conditions?;No, subadditivity does not hold under all conditions.
What property does VaR fail to satisfy?;VaR fails to satisfy the subadditivity property.
What is the key to the first two tests?;The key is to realize that shifting or scaling a random variable will also shift or scale its percentiles.
What is translation invariance?;Translation invariance is the property that shifting a random variable by a constant does not change its VaR.
What is positive homogeneity?;Positive homogeneity is the property that scaling a random variable by a positive constant multiplies its VaR by the same constant.If \(x > t\), then \(TVaR_t(x) \geq TVaR_t(x + c)\) for any positive constant \(c\).
