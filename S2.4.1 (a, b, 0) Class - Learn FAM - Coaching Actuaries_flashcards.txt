The annual number of claims per insured follows a Poisson distribution with mean;varies from insured to insured. The insurance company believes that follows an exponential distribution with mean 4.;Calculate the probability that:;Solution to (1)
Let be the annual number of claimquestion;answer
What is an exponential distribution a special case of?;A gamma distribution.
What is a negative binomial distribution with r equivalent to?;A geometric distribution.
What is the probability that an insured selected at random will file exactly 1 claim next year?;The desired probability.
What is the probability that an insured, who is believed to have an average number of claims of 4 per year, will file exactly 1 claim next year?;The desired probability.
How can the probability be calculated using the Law of Total Probability?;By calculating the probability for each possible scenario and summing them up.
What kind of frequency model does an insured have if they are given the mean number of claims they have?;A frequency model.What is the formula for calculating the Poisson distribution?;P(x) = (e^-λ * λ^x) / x!
What does each term in the formula represent?;P(x) represents the probability of getting exactly x events, e is the base of the natural logarithm, λ is the average rate of events occurring in a given time period, x is the actual number of events that occur in that time period, and x! represents the factorial of x.
What are the assumptions of the Poisson distribution?;The assumptions are that events occur independently of each other, the average rate of events remains constant over time, and the probability of more than one event occurring in an infinitesimally small time interval is negligible.
