What are the two methods to determine the most appropriate class distribution for a given set of data?;Method 1
What does Method 1 compare to determine the most suitable distribution?;Method 1 compares the sample mean and unbiased sample variance.
What distributions are compared in Method 1?;The distributions compared in Method 1 are Poisson, Binomial, and Negative binomial.
How can you determine which distribution is the most suitable based on the sample mean and sample variance?;If the sample mean is less than the sample variance, a negative binomial distribution would likely fit the sample the best among the three distributions (Poisson, Binomial, and Negative binomial).
Do you need to memorize the table of mean vs. variance for each distribution?;No, the table is not needed to be memorized as the inequalities are based on the mean and variance formulas of each distribution, which are given in the exam table.Question
What is the slope for the Poisson distribution?;0
What is the slope for the Binomial distribution?;-
What is the slope for the Negative Binomial distribution?;+
How can we determine the most appropriate distribution?;Calculate  for successive values of  and observe whether they are constant, decreasing, or increasing.
How can we estimate  ?;We can estimate  as where  is the number of observed .
What can we do to both the numerator and the denominator of  ?;We can multiply both the numerator and the denominator of  by .Question
How can we determine the most appropriate distribution?;By comparing the sample mean and variance.
Is the mean greater than the variance in this case?;Yes.
Therefore, what distribution do we recommend for this data?;The binomial distribution.Question
How do we determine the most appropriate distribution for the data?;We compare the sample mean and variance.
What are the values of the sample mean and variance?;The values of the sample mean and variance are unknown.
Can we confidently conclude that a binomial distribution is the best fit for the data?;No, we cannot confidently conclude that a binomial distribution is the best fit for the data.
What should we try next?;We should try another distribution.question
What is the expectation for the sample mean and variance?;They are not expected to be exactly equal.
What should we be cautious of when comparing the sample mean and variance?;Making a decision too quickly when the values are unequal but close.Q
What can we conclude if the ratio of sample mean to sample variance is around 1.00?;We can conclude that Poisson is the best fit.
What should we do if the ratio is not around 1.00?;We should consider other probability distributions for our data.
