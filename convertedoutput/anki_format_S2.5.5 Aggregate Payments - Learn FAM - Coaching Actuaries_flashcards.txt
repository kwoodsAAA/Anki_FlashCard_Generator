How can we model the aggregate payment?;There are two ways to model the aggregate payment.
What is the first way to model the aggregate payment?;The first way is to consider all losses and sum the resulting payment amounts, even if the payment amounts are 0.
What is the notation for the aggregate model?;The notation for the aggregate model is "S".
What is the second way to model the aggregate payment?;The second way is to only consider losses that result in positive payments and sum the payment amounts.
What is the key to ensuring consistency in frequency and severity?;The key is to make sure the frequency and severity are consistent, either both in terms of losses or both in terms of payments.Question
Give an example of the aggregate payment model.;A policyholder has a 30% chance to incur a loss each year. In the event of a loss, the amount has the following distribution
How do we calculate the variance of the amount the insurer pays the policyholder in a year?;We can calculate the mean and variance of the aggregate payments using the number of losses and payment per loss approach.question;answer
What is the alternative approach to calculate the mean and variance of aggregate payments?;We can also calculate the mean and variance of the aggregate payments using the number of payment and payment per payment approach.
What can be split into two independent categories in the example?;The claims can be split into two independent categories
What is the property of the sum of independent Poisson random variables?;The sum of independent Poisson random variables is a Poisson random variable.
What is the reverse property of the sum of independent Poisson random variables?;The reverse is also true.Question
What distribution does the number of claims that exceed the deductible follow?;Poisson distribution with mean.
What distribution does the payment per payment follow?;Uniform distribution.
How do you calculate the mean and variance of the payment per payment?;Using the formulas for mean and variance.
How do you calculate the mean and variance of the aggregate payment?;Substitute the values into the formulas.
Are the mean and variance of the aggregate payment the same as those calculated using the previous approach?;Yes.
How do you calculate the desired probability?;Calculate it using the appropriate method.
What is the coach's remark?;The coach's remark is not provided.1. What concept is not applicable to the other class distributions?;The concept of splitting the Poisson distribution
What is the expected insurance payment in a year?;The expected insurance payment in a year is the aggregate insurance payment.
Where can I find more information about aggregate payments in the Coaching Actuaries course?;You can find more information about aggregate payments in the Coaching Actuaries course under the section "S2.5.5 Aggregate Payments" in the "F AM" module.
