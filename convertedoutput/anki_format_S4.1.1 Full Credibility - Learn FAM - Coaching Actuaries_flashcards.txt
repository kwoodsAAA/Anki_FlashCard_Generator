Graphically, if there are 864.32 exposures, what is the range of the average annual claim size with 95% probability?;Graphically, if there are 864.32 exposures, the range of the average annual claim size with 95% probability is between 3.8 and 4.2.question;What distribution does Winson use to model the number of claims per week?
Are the claim frequency and severity independent in this example?;Yes, the claim frequency and severity are independent.
What is the requirement for the aggregate loss in this example?;The aggregate loss has to be within 3% of the expected loss with a probability of 90%.
What theory is used to determine the number of exposures needed for full credibility?;Limited fluctuation credibility theory is used to determine the number of exposures needed for full credibility.
What are the variables used in the solution?;Let N and S be the annual number of claims and the loss severity, respectively.
How do we calculate the mean and variance of the aggregate loss per year?;Since N and S are independent, we apply the compound mean and variance formulas, i.e., E[aggregate loss] = E[N] * E[S] and Var[aggregate loss] = E[N] * Var[S] + Var[N] * E[S].
What is the final step to determine the number of exposures needed for full credibility?;The final step is to use limited fluctuation credibility theory to calculate the number of exposures needed for full credibility.r of claims for the 864.32 insureds is 864.32 multiplied by 5, which is equal to 4321.6 claims.1. What is the formula for the expected number of claims needed for full credibility?
What does it mean for the full credibility standard to be based on frequency?;When the full credibility standard is based on frequency, it is met by satisfying certain conditions related to the frequency of claims.
What does it mean for the full credibility standard to be based on severity?;When the full credibility standard is based on severity, it is met by satisfying certain conditions related to the severity of claims.
How can we calculate the standard for full credibility in terms of frequency?;We can calculate the standard for full credibility in terms of frequency by modifying certain components.
How can we calculate the standard for full credibility in terms of severity?;We can calculate the standard for full credibility in terms of severity by modifying certain components.
What should we do if the standard is based on frequency only?;If the standard is based on frequency only, we should set the severity component to 0.
What should we do if the standard is based on severity only?;If the standard is based on severity only, we should set the frequency component to 0.
How can we express the standard for full credibility in terms of a different variable?;We can express the standard for full credibility in terms of a different variable by rearranging certain equations.
