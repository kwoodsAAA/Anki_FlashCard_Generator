What is Value-at-Risk (VaR)?;For a continuous random variable, its VaR at the 100% level is.
Where can the VaR formula for most distributions be found?;The VaR formula for most distributions can be found on the exam table.
What is Tail-Value-at-Risk (TVaR)?;For a continuous random variable, its TVaR at the 100% level is.
What are the TVaR formulas for normal and lognormal distributions?;The TVaR formulas for normal and lognormal distributions are
What properties should a coherent risk measure satisfy?;A risk measure is coherent if it satisfies all properties below
Is VaR coherent?;No, VaR is not coherent because it fails to satisfy the subadditivity property.
Is TVaR coherent?;Yes, TVaR is coherent.
What is the relation between the existence of positive raw moments and tail weight?;The fewer positive raw moments that exist, the greater the tail weight.
