What is the PMF of a Poisson distribution with mean λ?;The PMF is given by P(X=k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!
What is a key property of the Poisson distribution?;The mean equals the variance.
What is the sum of independent Poisson random variables?;The sum follows a Poisson distribution with mean equal to the sum of the means of the individual variables.question
What is a Poisson distribution?;The number of occurrences.
What is a binomial distribution?;A distribution with parameters n and p, where n is the number of independent trials and p is the probability of an event of interest occurring in each trial.
What is the PMF of a binomial distribution?;P(X=k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
What is the mean of a binomial distribution?;Mean = n * p
What is the variance of a binomial distribution?;Variance = n * p * (1-p)
Can the sum of independent binomial random variables with the same parameter be a binomial random variable?;Yes.1. What is a Bernoulli distribution?; A binomial distribution with p=1.
What is the PMF, mean, and variance of a geometric distribution?;The PMF, mean, and variance of a geometric distribution are simplified to 9/30/23, 7
What is the sum of i.i.d geometric random variables?;The sum of i.i.d geometric random variables follows a negative binomial distribution with parameters p and r.
What is the memoryless property of the geometric distribution?;The memoryless property states that for a geometric distribution, the probability of an event occurring in the future does not depend on how long it has been since the last event occurred.
What is an example of the memoryless property of the geometric distribution?;An insured owns 3 cars in Year 1 and 4 cars in Year 2. Each car has a 10% chance of getting into an accident, and can only get into at most 1 accident per year. The car accidents are independent of each other.
What is the probability that the insured gets into at most 1 accident in two years?;The probability can be calculated using the geometric distribution.question
What property do the discrete distributions introduced above belong to?;The discrete distributions introduced above belong to the "class" distribution.
What are the signs of α and β for the Poisson distribution?;The signs of α and β for the Poisson distribution are 0 and +, respectively.
What are the signs of α and β for the Binomial distribution?;The signs of α and β for the Binomial distribution are - and +, respectively.
What are the signs of α and β for the Negative Binomial distribution?;The signs of α and β for the Negative Binomial distribution are + and +, respectively.Q
What is the relationship used to form two equations?;Use this relationship to form two equations.
How do you solve for a and b?;Solve for a and b.
What distribution is the negative binomial distribution?;The distribution is negative binomial.
How do you determine the values of the parameters?;Use the formulas provided in the exam table to determine the values of the parameters.
What is the mean of the negative binomial distribution?;The mean of the negative binomial distribution is Poisson-Gamma Mixture.
How can a negative binomial distribution be created?;One way to create a negative binomial distribution is by mixing Poisson distributions.Let's apply the Poisson-gamma mixture in an example.;Example S2.4.1.3
