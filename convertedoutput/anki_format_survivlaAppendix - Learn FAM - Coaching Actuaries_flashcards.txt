What is the expected value formula using the survival function method?;The expected value of a function can be rewritten as follows using integration by parts.
What are the requirements for simplifying the expected value formula?;The two requirements that need to be fulfilled are
What is the formula for the central moment?;The formula for the central moment is  .
What is the formula for the 4th central moment?;The formula for the 4th central moment is .Question
How do we apply the Law of Total Expectation?;We apply the Law of Total Expectation by taking the expectation of the conditional variance and adding it to the variance of the conditional mean.
What is the equation for the Law of Total Variance?;The equation for the Law of Total Variance is Var(X) = E[Var(X|Y)] + Var(E[X|Y]).
How can we translate the second half of the equation for the Law of Total Variance?;The second half of the equation for the Law of Total Variance can be translated to Var(E[X|Y]) = E[Var(X|Y)] + Var(E[X]).
What are the two forms of the Biased Sample Variance?;The two forms of the Biased Sample Variance are the sample variance formula using the sum of squared deviations and the sample variance formula using the sum of squared observations.
