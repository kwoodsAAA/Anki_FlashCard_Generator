What is incomplete data?;Incomplete data refers to not having the exact values of the full dataset or only having a partial dataset.
What are some examples of incomplete data?;Some examples of incomplete data include truncation, censoring, and grouping.
What is truncated data?;Truncated data is an example of an incomplete dataset.
What does it mean if a dataset is left-truncated?;If a dataset is left-truncated, it means that the dataset does not include data at or below a certain value.
How do we condition the likelihood of every observation in a left-truncated dataset?;We condition the likelihood of every observation in a left-truncated dataset on being above a certain value.
What does it mean if a dataset is right-truncated?;If a dataset is right-truncated, it means that the dataset does not include data at or above a certain value.
How do we condition the likelihood of every observation in a right-truncated dataset?;We condition the likelihood of every observation in a right-truncated dataset on being below a certain value.
What is a common example of a left-truncated case?;A common example of a left-truncated case is often seen in survival analysis.question;What is the purpose of a deductible in insurance?
How many payments were observed at the policy limit?;Two
What is the likelihood for each payment at the policy limit?;9/30/23
What is the range of claim sizes?;From 1 to infinity
What distribution is used to model the claim sizes?;Single-parameter Pareto
What are the parameters of the Pareto distribution?;Unknownquestion;answer
What is the log-likelihood function?;The log-likelihood function is the natural logarithm of the likelihood function.
What is an example of incomplete data?;An example of incomplete data is when not all the information about a group of policies is provided.
What information is given about a group of policies?;The given information about a group of policies includes the claim payment, deductible, and policy limit for each policy.
What is the assumption made about payments at the policy limit?;The assumption is that payments at the policy limit resulted from losses above the maximum covered loss.
How can you fit a continuous distribution to the losses using the maximum likelihood method?;By using the maximum likelihood method, a continuous distribution can be fitted to the losses by estimating the parameters that maximize the likelihood function.
What is the task in this scenario?;The task is to determine the likelihood function for the given group of policies.
What is the solution to the task?;The solution to the task is not provided in the given text.question;answer
