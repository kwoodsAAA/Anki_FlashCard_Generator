What distribution does the aggregate loss follow when using the normal approximation?;The aggregate loss follows a normal distribution with mean 1,500 and variance 450,000.
How do we calculate the desired probability?;Calculate the desired probability using the normal distribution.
When using a continuous distribution to approximate a discrete distribution, what correction do we need to apply?;We need to apply continuity correction.
Why should we always use continuity correction when approximating a discrete quantity with a continuous distribution?;We should always use continuity correction to ensure accurate results.Q
When is the aggregate loss model considered discrete?;The aggregate loss model is considered discrete when both the frequency and severity models are discrete.
What is the example provided in the text?;The example provided in the text is about determining the probability that a certain variable equals 5 using the normal approximation.
Why is approximating with the normal distribution an issue?;Approximating with the normal distribution can be an issue when the actual value of the variable is non-zero.
How is the variable approximated?;The variable is approximated as .
How can we derive other normal-approximated probabilities?;We can use the above approximation to derive other normal-approximated probabilities.
What range should be included when approximating ?;When approximating , the range 4.5 to 5.5 should be included.
How is approximated?;is approximated by .Question
What is the probability distribution for the number of deaths in each road crash?;The probability distribution for the number of deaths in each road crash is as follows
Are the number of road crashes and the number of deaths for each road crash independent?;Yes, the number of road crashes and the number of deaths for each road crash are mutually independent.
What is the probability of having more than 15 road deaths in Town ABC in a year?;Using the normal approximation with continuity correction, the probability of having more than 15 road deaths in Town ABC in a year can be calculated.For aggregate loss, the number of road deaths in a year is denoted by X.
Calculate the aggregate mean of X.;μ = E(X)
Calculate the aggregate variance of X.;σ^2 = Var(X)
How is X approximated by a normal distribution?;X is approximated by a normal distribution.
Why do we need to use the continuity correction for X?;Because X is discrete, we need to use the continuity correction.
What is the final answer after applying continuity correction?;The final answer is obtained after applying continuity correction.
When is X discrete but does not assume the value of every integer?;X is discrete but does not assume the value of every integer when the possible values of X are not consecutive integers.
How do we apply continuity correction in this case?;We apply continuity correction using the midpoints between possible values of X.
What is an example that illustrates this idea?;An example illustrating the idea of continuity correction is provided in Example S2.5.3.3.
What is the approximate value of  is?;0.66732

Can you provide an example of normal approximation?;Example S2.5.3.4
What is the solution to (1)?;The solution is to use the lognormal approximation. Equate the lognormal's mean and variance to the aggregate mean and variance.1. What formulas are provided on the exam table?; The moment formulas
