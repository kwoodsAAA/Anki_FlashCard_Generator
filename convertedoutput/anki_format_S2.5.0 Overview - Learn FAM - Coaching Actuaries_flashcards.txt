What are the two concepts related to insurance losses?;The two concepts related to insurance losses are loss count (frequency) and individual loss sizes (severity).
How is aggregate loss calculated?;Aggregate loss is calculated by summing all of the individual losses.
What is the frequency random variable?;The frequency random variable describes the number of losses.
What is the severity random variable?;The severity random variable describes the size of the loss.
What are the assumptions of the collective risk model?;The assumptions of the collective risk model are that all existing losses are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, and any existing frequency and severity variables are independent.
What are the primary distribution and secondary distribution in the collective risk model?;The primary distribution and secondary distribution refer to the distribution of the frequency and severity variables, respectively.
What does it mean when the frequency random variable is 0?;When the frequency random variable is 0, it means that there are no losses.
How many types of aggregate loss models are there?;There are two types of aggregate loss models.question;And the distribution of is called the compound distribution.
