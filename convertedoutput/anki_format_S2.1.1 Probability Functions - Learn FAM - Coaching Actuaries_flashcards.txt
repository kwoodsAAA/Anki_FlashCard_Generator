What does it mean if the PDF evaluated at one value is greater than at another value?;It means that the first value is more likely to be in the neighborhood of the second value than in the neighborhood of any other value.
What are the two properties that PDFs must satisfy to be valid?;PDFs must be non-negative and the integral of the PDF over all values of the random variable must equal 1.
Can PDFs exceed 1?;Yes, PDFs can exceed 1 because they do not represent actual probabilities. A PDF above 1 does not translate to a probability exceeding 1.
