What is the topic of this section?;Inflation
How is inflation often paired in exam questions?;With coverage modifications
What is the scenario described in Example S2.3.4.1?;Losses follow a single-parameter Pareto distribution and increase by 10% each year due to inflation.
What is the policy limit in the given scenario?;220
What is the goal in this scenario?;To calculate the expected insurance payment next year.
What formula can be used to calculate the limited expected value?;Look up the limited expected value formula from the exam table.
What concept can be applied to solve the problem?;ScalingQuestion
What distribution do next year's losses follow?;A single-parameter Pareto distribution.
What is the limited expected value?;9/30/23, 7
What is the conclusion from the example above?;The conclusion is that  is the inflation rate.
What is the formula for loss elimination ratio with an ordinary deductible?;Recall the loss elimination ratio formula for an ordinary deductible.
What is the loss elimination ratio formula for an ordinary deductible?;The loss elimination ratio formula for an ordinary deductible is 9/30/23, 7
What is the loss in 2016 represented by?;The loss in 2016 is represented by .
What is the difference between the loss elimination ratios in 2016 and 2017?;Calculate the difference between the loss elimination ratios in 2016 and 2017.question
What is the loss elimination ratio in 2016?;The loss elimination ratio in 2016 is not provided in the given text.
What are the losses in 2017 represented by?;The losses in 2017 are represented by an unknown value as it is not provided in the given text.
What is the loss elimination ratio in 2017?;The loss elimination ratio in 2017 is not provided in the given text.
What is the formula to calculate the mean and limited expected value of losses in 2017?;The formula to calculate the mean and limited expected value of losses in 2017 is not provided in the given text.
How can we add the effects of inflation to the loss variable?;The text does not provide the specific method of adding the effects of inflation to the loss variable.Q
When does the alternative method only work?;When the distribution of  has a scale parameter.
What are the two cases where the ultimate formula is not commonly seen?;1) Franchise deductible, where the maximum covered loss is less than it would be for an ordinary deductible.
What is the deductible for the policy mentioned in the text?;The deductible is 600.
How much higher are the losses assumed to be next year?;The losses are assumed to be 20% higher next year.
What are the options the insurer is considering adding to the policy starting next year?;The options are a policy limit of 3,000 or a coinsurance.
What is the formula for calculating expected payments under the policy limit option?;Expected payment = [CDF value at policy limit] * [policy limit]
What is the formula for calculating expected payments under the coinsurance option?;Expected payment = [CDF value at deductible] * [deductible] / [coinsurance factor]
What is the equation used to solve for the coinsurance factor?;Equate the two expected payments and solve for the coinsurance factor.Question
What does Example S2.3.4.4 illustrate?;Example S2.3.4.4 illustrates a distribution with a special property.
What is the deductible and maximum covered loss in the given insurance policy?;The deductible is 20 and the maximum covered loss is 100.
What type of distribution do the losses follow in the given insurance policy?;The losses follow a uniform distribution on the interval 0 to 200.
What does a policy limit of 100 indicate?;A policy limit of 100 indicates a maximum covered loss of 80.Question
How can you calculate the moments of a variable?;A simpler way to calculate 's moments is by calculating 's moments, and then converting them.
What is the payment per loss variable?;The insurer pays nothing for losses below the deductible; the amount in excess of the deductible for losses between the deductible and the maximum covered loss; the policy limit for losses greater than the maximum covered loss. The payment per loss variable is .
How can you calculate the first and second moments using first principles?;Calculate the first and second moments using first principles.
How can you convert 's moments to 's moments?;Using , convert 's moments to 's moments
How can you calculate the variance?;Finally, calculate the variance.
