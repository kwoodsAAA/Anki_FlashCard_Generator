What is the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?;The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is a reserving technique that finds a balance between the chain-ladder method and the expected loss ratio method to estimate ultimate losses.
How does the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method find a balance between the chain-ladder method and the expected loss ratio method?;The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method rationalizes the differences between the chain-ladder method, which relies on the loss triangle, and the expected loss ratio method, which only considers fully developed losses.
What is the formula for estimating the proportion of paid claims under the chain-ladder method?;The formula for estimating the proportion of paid claims under the chain-ladder method is (paid claims)/(ultimate losses).
What is the formula for estimating the proportion of unpaid claims under the chain-ladder method?;The formula for estimating the proportion of unpaid claims under the chain-ladder method is (unpaid claims)/(ultimate losses).
How can the unpaid claims estimate or reserve be calculated using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?;The unpaid claims estimate or reserve can be calculated by multiplying the ultimate losses by the estimated proportion of unpaid claims.Question
How does the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method combine the expected loss ratio method and the reserve calculation?;It multiplies the expected loss ratio estimate of the ultimate losses by the chain-ladder estimate of the proportion of unpaid claims.
What is the paid loss age-to-ultimate factor based on in the chain-ladder method?;It is based on the age of claims at valuation.
Are the ultimate losses in the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method the same as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson estimate of the ultimate losses?;No, they are not the same.
How does the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method estimate the ultimate losses?;It estimates the ultimate losses using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.Step 1
What is Step 1 in the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?;Estimate the ultimate losses using the expected loss ratio method.
What are the estimated ultimate losses for each accident year?;AY4
What is Step 2 in the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?;Calculate the volume-weighted average factor (VWAF).
How do you calculate the VWAF?;VWAF = (Total Earned Premium / Total Expected Ultimate Losses).
What is Step 3 in the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?;Calculate the reserve as of 12/31/AY7 using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.
How do you calculate the reserve?;Reserve = (Total Loss Payments + (VWAF * Total Expected Ultimate Losses)) * (1 - Development Factor).
What is the formula for the reserve calculation?;Reserve = (1,400 + 2,550 + 3,650 + 3,800 + (VWAF * (3,840 + 3,510 + 4,015 + 4,543))) * (1 - Development Factor).Step 2
How do we calculate the chain-ladder reserves?;Accidents Year 4
What are the weights used for calculation?;Accidents Year 4
How do we calculate the Bornhuetter-Ferguson reserves?;Accidents Year 4
What is the reserve for AY2 using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?;1,250 * 0.71 = 888.75
What is the reserve for AY3 using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?;1,200 * 0.72 = 864
What is the reserve for AY4 using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method?;1,500 * 0.69 = 1,035Question
What is the Expected loss ratio reserve?;78,600
What is the Earned premium?;250,000
What is the Expected loss ratio?;0.65
How can we calculate the chain-ladder reserve?;We need the losses paid-to-date and the age-to-ultimate factor.
How can we determine the age-to-ultimate factor?;By using the information provided.
How can we find the losses paid-to-date?;By using the expected loss ratio method.
