 question: What is the empirical distribution?
answer: The empirical distribution is a discrete distribution based on a sample of size that assigns probability to each data point.

question: How is the empirical distribution function calculated?
answer: The empirical distribution function is calculated as the proportion of observations no more than x out of total observations, where x is a data point.

question: What is the empirical distribution function?
answer: The empirical distribution function is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the empirical distribution.

question: What is the shape of the empirical distribution function?
answer: The empirical distribution function is a step function.

question: How do we calculate the empirical 100th percentile?
answer: The empirical 100th percentile is calculated as the order statistic of the sample, where all observations are equally likely.Question: What is the order statistic?
Answer: The order statistic is the smallest observation in a sample.

Question: Give an example of order statistics.
Answer: Given a sample {5, 0, 3, 2, 5}, the order statistics are 0, 2, 3, 5, 5.

Question: How can the empirical expected value be calculated?
Answer: The empirical expected value can be calculated using the sample mean.

Question: What is the sample mean denoted as?
Answer: The sample mean is denoted as the empirical 1st raw moment.

Question: What is the biased sample variance?
Answer: The biased sample variance is the empirical 2nd central moment.

Question: What is the unbiased sample variance denoted as?
Answer: The unbiased sample variance is denoted as the biased sample variance divided by (n-1), where n is the sample size.

Question: What is the equivalence of the two forms of variance?
Answer: The equivalence of the two forms of variance is provided in the appendix at the end of this section.

Question: When should the biased sample variance be used?
Answer: The biased sample variance should be used when calculating the variance of the empirical distribution.1. What is the recommended estimation method for population variance?
Answer: Use the unbiased sample variance.

2. When should the unbiased sample variance be used?
Answer: When the estimation method is left unspecified.

3. What does the symbol "S" typically represent?
Answer: The population variance.

4. How is the empirical distribution different from the population distribution?
Answer: The empirical distribution treats the sample data as though it is the entire population.

5. What is the formula for the variance of the empirical distribution?
Answer: It closely resembles the formula for the population variance.

6. What is the biased sample variance conceptually distinct from?
Answer: The population variance.
