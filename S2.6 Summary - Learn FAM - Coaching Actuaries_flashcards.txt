Question: What properties should a coherent risk measure satisfy?
Answer: A risk measure is coherent if it satisfies all properties below: Translation invariance, Positive homogeneity, Subadditivity, Monotonicity.

Question: Is VaR coherent?
Answer: No, VaR is not coherent because it fails to satisfy the subadditivity property.

Question: Is TVaR coherent?
Answer: Yes, TVaR is coherent.

Question: What is the relation between the existence of positive raw moments and tail weight?
Answer: The fewer positive raw moments that exist, the greater the tail weight.
