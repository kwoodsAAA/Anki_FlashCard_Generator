 What is the expected annual total claim size for each Iowa driver that All-Care should use in their analysis?;Something in betweenWhat is the expected aggregate claim calculation method?
The weighted average of the two numbers.

What are the considerations for using internal observations?
Better addressing the specific need but likely limited sample size.

What are the considerations for using industry-wide data?
Larger sample size but might be too general.

What is the key question in determining the weight between internal data and industry-wide data?
How much weight should be placed on All-Care's internal data compared to the industry-wide data?

What is the credibility factor?
A weight assigned to the sample/observations.

What does  represent?
The weight assigned to the sample/observations.

What does  represent?
The weight assigned to the general group.

What is the relationship between  and ?
 must be equal to 1.

What does a  of 0.3 mean?
30% credibility is assigned to All-Care's internal observations, and 70% credibility is assigned to the industry-wide data.1. What is the annual aggregate claim per insured estimated to be?
Answer: The annual aggregate claim per insured is estimated to be [the value is not provided].

2. What does the larger value of [a variable] indicate?
Answer: The larger the value of [a variable], the more we trust the sample of observations.

3. What are the three properties reflected in [a variable]?
Answer: The three properties reflected in [a variable] are: [property 1], [property 2], and [property 3].

4. What does [a variable] represent in the three properties mentioned?
Answer: [A variable] represents the number of observations in the sample.

5. What does the oﬃcial textbook use instead of [a variable]?
Answer: The oﬃcial textbook uses [a different variable] instead of [a variable] for the three properties above.

6. What is the worst-case scenario if [a variable] is?
Answer: The worst-case scenario if [a variable] is [a value] is that we discard the data.

7. What does [a different variable] imply?
Answer: [A different variable] implies that we rely entirely on the data.

8. What must [a variable] be in between?
Answer: [A variable] must be in between [the lower bound] and [the upper bound].

9. What is the relationship between the change in the credibility factor and the number of observations?
Answer: As the number of observations increases, the change in the credibility factor is always positive.

10. How does the credibility factor change when the number of observations increases?
Answer: Increasing the number of observations also increases the credibility factor.

11. What happens to the ratio of [a variable] as the number of observations increases?
Answer: As the number of observations increases, the ratio of [a variable] decreases.

12. What does a larger change in the credibility factor indicate?
Answer: A larger change in the credibility factor indicates that the credibility factor increases by a larger amount when the number of observations is smaller.Q: What is the impact of adding 500 observations to a dataset of 250 observations compared to adding 500 observations to a sample of 1,000,000 observations?
A: Adding 500 observations to a dataset of 250 observations will have a greater impact than adding 500 observations to a sample of 1,000,000 observations.

Q: What is classical credibility also known as?
A: Classical credibility is also known as limited fluctuation credibility.

Q: What does classical credibility suggest?
A: Classical credibility suggests how large the sample has to be to assign 100% credibility to the observations.
