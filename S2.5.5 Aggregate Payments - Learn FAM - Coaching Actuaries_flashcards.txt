 question: How can we model the aggregate payment?
answer: There are two ways to model the aggregate payment.

question: What is the first way to model the aggregate payment?
answer: The first way is to consider all losses and sum the resulting payment amounts, even if the payment amounts are 0.

question: What is the notation for the aggregate model?
answer: The notation for the aggregate model is "S".

question: What is the second way to model the aggregate payment?
answer: The second way is to only consider losses that result in positive payments and sum the payment amounts.

question: What is the key to ensuring consistency in frequency and severity?
answer: The key is to make sure the frequency and severity are consistent, either both in terms of losses or both in terms of payments.Question: What is the aggregate payment model?
Answer: The aggregate payment model is no different than the aggregate loss model. Instead of summing the losses, we sum the payments. Therefore, the compound mean and variance formulas still hold.

Question: Give an example of the aggregate payment model.
Answer: A policyholder has a 30% chance to incur a loss each year. In the event of a loss, the amount has the following distribution: 100 (0.4), 200 (0.3), 500 (0.3). Each loss is subject to a deductible of 150. The number of losses and the loss amounts are mutually independent.

Question: How do we calculate the variance of the amount the insurer pays the policyholder in a year?
Answer: We can calculate the mean and variance of the aggregate payments using the number of losses and payment per loss approach.question;answer
Calculate the mean and variance of the number of losses.;Mean: ?, Variance: ?
Calculate the mean and variance of the payment per loss.;Mean: ?, Variance: ?
What is the formula for calculating the variance of aggregate payments?;Variance = ?
How can we calculate the mean and variance of the aggregate payments using the number of payments and payment per payment approach?;?
How do we construct the number of payments distribution?;?
When will there be no payment?;When there is no loss or when the loss is less than the deductible.
When will there be 1 payment?;When there is a loss that exceeds the deductible.
Calculate the mean and variance of the number of payments.;Mean: ?, Variance: ?
How do we construct the payment per payment distribution?;?
Calculate the mean and variance of the payment per payment distribution.;Mean: ?, Variance: ?Calculate the mean and variance of the payment per payment:
Mean: 25 * ((55+5)/2) = 700
Variance: ((55-5)^2)/12 = 400

Calculate the variance of aggregate payments:
Variance = 25 * 400 = 10,000

Using the normal approximation, determine the probability that an aggregate payment does not exceed 110% of the expected aggregate payment:
Mean: 25 * 700 = 17,500
Standard deviation: sqrt(10,000) = 100
Z-Score: (1.1 * 17,500 - 17,500) / 100 = 0.1
Probability: 1 - P(Z <= 0.1) = 0.4602Question: What is the formula to calculate the mean and variance of aggregate payment?
Answer: Substitute into the formulas to calculate the mean and variance of the aggregate payment.

Question: What is the alternative approach to calculate the mean and variance of aggregate payments?
Answer: We can also calculate the mean and variance of the aggregate payments using the number of payment and payment per payment approach.

Question: What can be split into two independent categories in the example?
Answer: The claims can be split into two independent categories: those that exceed the deductible and those that don't.

Question: What is the property of the sum of independent Poisson random variables?
Answer: The sum of independent Poisson random variables is a Poisson random variable.

Question: What is the reverse property of the sum of independent Poisson random variables?
Answer: The reverse is also true.Question: What distribution does the number of claims that don't exceed the deductible follow? 
Answer: Poisson distribution with mean.

Question: What distribution does the number of claims that exceed the deductible follow? 
Answer: Poisson distribution with mean.

Question: What distribution does the payment per payment follow? 
Answer: Uniform distribution.

Question: How do you calculate the mean and variance of the payment per payment? 
Answer: Using the formulas for mean and variance.

Question: How do you calculate the mean and variance of the aggregate payment? 
Answer: Substitute the values into the formulas.

Question: Are the mean and variance of the aggregate payment the same as those calculated using the previous approach? 
Answer: Yes.

Question: How do you calculate the desired probability? 
Answer: Calculate it using the appropriate method.

Question: What is the coach's remark? 
Answer: The coach's remark is not provided.1. What concept is not applicable to the other class distributions?;The concept of splitting the Poisson distribution
2. What is the only option if the example had a binomial or negative binomial loss frequency?;To use the number of losses and payment per loss approach
3. What is the average number of claims per year for the auto insurance policy?;300
4. Are the number of claims and amount of each claim mutually independent?;Yes
5. What is the policy limit for each claim?;10
6. What is the expected insurance payment in a year?;Solution not providedQ: What is the limited moments formula?
A: The limited moments formula is used to calculate the expected payment per claim.

Q: What is the expected insurance payment in a year?
A: The expected insurance payment in a year is the aggregate insurance payment.
