Answer: The two ways to proceed are the loss ratio method 1 and the loss ratio method 2.Question: What is the formula used under the loss ratio method? 
Answer: Let  be the premium at the current rate level. If we divide  by , we will have:

Question: Why is it called the loss ratio method? 
Answer: This formula uses , or the loss ratio, which is why this is called the loss ratio method.

Question: What is the formula used for the pure premium method? 
Answer: Let  be the number of exposures. If we divide  by , we will have:

Question: Why is it called the pure premium method? 
Answer: This method is called the pure premium method because  is the pure premium, or loss per exposure.Question: What is the formula to calculate the indicated average rate change?
Answer: Multiply the current average rate by 1 + the indicated average rate change.

Question: Is the indicated average rate change associated with a specific rating variable?
Answer: No, it is the overall average rate change across all rating variables.

Question: What are the given values for the calculation?
Answer: Premium at current rate level = 120,000; Projected loss and loss adjustment expenses = 74,000; Projected number of exposures = 1,000; Variable expense ratio = 20%; Fixed expenses per exposure unit = 25; Target profit and contingencies = 5%; Current average rate = 120.

Question: What is the indicated average rate under the pure premium method?
Answer: The indicated average rate is not provided in the given information.question;Apply under the pure premium method. The indicated average rate is:
answer;10%
question;If we were to use the indicated average rate change of 10% to calculate the indicated average rate under the loss ratio method, we would get:
answer;10%
question;Note that in the example above, both methods resulted in the same indicated average rate. This will not be the case in general. For example, if the premium at the current rate level is calculated using the parallelogram method, there will be discrepancies between the two approaches. The equivalence of these methods depends on using consistent data and assumptions for both approaches.
