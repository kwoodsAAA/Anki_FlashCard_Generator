 1. What is coinsurance?
Coinsurance is the portion of loss the insurer is responsible for.

2. What is the formula for coinsurance?
For a policy with coinsurance of c, the insurer will pay c times the loss amount, while the policyholder will pay the rest (1-c) times the loss amount.

3. How is the expected payment calculated for coinsurance?
The expected payment is calculated by multiplying the expected loss by the coinsurance.

4. What are the two methods for handling coinsurance when a policy has both a deductible and coinsurance?
The two methods are handling coinsurance before or after the deductible is met.

5. What is the default method for handling coinsurance when a policy has both a deductible and coinsurance?
By default, the coinsurance only comes into play after the deductible is met.

6. What is the payment per loss variable for a policy with deductible D and coinsurance c?
The payment per loss variable is D + c times the excess amount.

7. What is the average payment for a policy with deductible D and coinsurance c?
The average payment is (D + c times the expected excess amount) times the probability of a loss greater than the deductible.1. What is applied before the deductible?
- The coinsurance

2. How is the coinsured portion of the loss applied?
- The insurer will only apply the coinsured portion of the loss.

3. What is the policyholder responsible for?
- The remaining portion of the loss, plus the amount needed to meet the deductible.

4. What is the equation for the payment per loss variable?
- The equation is: payment per loss = (coinsurance * loss) + deductible.

5. How can the equation be expressed to get the same form as when coinsurance is applied after the deductible?
- By defining the deductible as (deductible / coinsurance).

6. How should the deductible be adjusted if the coinsurance is applied before the deductible?
- Divide the deductible by the coinsurance.

7. How should the problem be solved if the coinsurance is applied before the deductible?
- Solve it the same way as the case where the coinsurance is applied after.

8. What is the average payment in this case?
- The average payment is not specified in the provided text.1. What is the point that defines whether the loss meets the deductible?
- The point that defines whether the loss meets the deductible is the deductible itself.

2. When will the insurer start sharing the cost?
- The insurer will start sharing the cost only when the loss is greater than the deductible.

3. What is the general formula for the expected payment per loss?
- The general formula for the expected payment per loss is:
Expected payment per loss = min(max(loss - deductible, 0), policy limit) * (1 - coinsurance)Question: What is the maximum covered loss?
Answer: The loss amount above which the insurer pays the policy limit.

Question: When is there a maximum covered loss?
Answer: There is a maximum covered loss only when there is a policy limit.

Question: What happens if a policy only has a policy limit?
Answer: The limited expectation is evaluated at the maximum covered loss.

Question: What happens if a policy has a policy limit and a deductible?
Answer: The limited expectation is evaluated at the maximum covered loss.
